<p id="writing">I have enjoyed every step of the application process to apply for the course at Founders
   and Coders. I have learnt and developed my skill set along the way. It's been very exciting to learn and 
   grow and to feel like this can be more a realistic opportunity. My inspiration to apply for the course
    was based on the recommendations of a friend who studied at Founders and Coders. I believe it's an
     incredible opportunity which should be a life changing experience for me and my other peers. I am 
     excited to work with like-minded individuals, so we can learn from each other. It's highly motivating 
     to see a coding course combine social issues with the tech industry. Personally, the opportunity to 
     study on the course not only means a chance for a career change but also a way to make a positive impact 
     within a dynamic, creative, and ethical environment. The curriculum looks well thought out and thorough 
     and I can see it has received such high praise.</p>
<p id="writing2">I am extremely encouraged by your goal to make the tech industry more diverse, 
  inclusive and collaborative. I have looked at several other courses and the main selling point that they all 
  highlight is the potential salary however I believe there are more important things in life. I view tech
   as the most important industry in shaping the future of society and how we relate to work, the world, and 
   each other. For an industry that is supposedly being led by the most progressive generation in history, it 
   is deeply disheartening to watch it fall into familiar patterns. </p>
   <p id="writing3">Although I am a white male, I have
   worked several gig economy jobs and have been disappointed (although not surprised) that the contractor/workers
    are representative of the culturally diverse London I grew up in, whereas those further up the hierarchy are almost all people who look like me.
I grew up in a forward thinking, political household and was attending protests from when I was a child. I studied politics at
     university because I wanted to educate myself enough on these issues to make sure I was on the right side of
      history so I could be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. The more I learned, the more
      I learned there was to do in using my position of privilege to support those without it.
</p>

  <p id="writing4">
Although there is always more to learn, I have tried to embark on the lifelong journey of being a good ally.
Through attending the BLM protests and having conversations with friends in their wake, I learned a lot
 about the structural issues still facing so many people today. Discussions with friends during the Me Too
  movement were very enlightening. Growing up with an feminist, activist, lesbian mother, an awareness of
   women’s issues played a major role in the formation of my sense of morality, but it took people speaking
    up about their personal experience for me to realise just how pervasive these issues are.</p>
    <p id="writing5"> I think it’s
     excellent that you are encouraging people to educate themselves about these issues and I plan to 
     incorporate these lessons into all my future work. 
I have learned that what it takes to be a good ally is listening, helping to build power in disadvantaged
        communities, and playing a supporting role, rather than trying to use my own power to solve problems for others.
</p>
<p id="writing6">
   Technology has the power to isolate us but also the power to bring us together. One of the reasons that I
    want to learn to code is to pursue my idea for a platform which will be a place for cooperatively run,
     ethical businesses to find each other, make business connections, and trade.  I would include an 
     area for supporters, customers, and other community groups to get involved, as well as areas for 
     organising in support of each other and fundraising for mutual assistance. </p>
       <p id="writing7">It could be used to organise food/necessities distribution, help in the wake of disasters,
      or shelter for the unhoused as some examples. As well as this, disadvantaged groups can use it to 
      crowdsource funds as well as physical help to start new businesses and organisations that can give
       back and elevate the community. Crucially, it will be done in a way that encourages reciprocal 
       relationships and community sharing and strengthening rather than simply charity.</p>
       <p id="writing8">  This will help forge
      connections between groups of people who have experience taking an active role in decision making
       in their lives and building strength. The platform itself would be run as
        a cooperative, which would involve me ceding control and personal gain to work towards a better 
        outcome for all.
      
      It would be a privilege to start my journey into coding with a course that takes these matters 
      seriously and be among a collection of like-minded people so we can share ideas about how to 
      improve the teach industry and make the world a better place.</p>
